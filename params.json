{"name":"uDeviceX","tagline":"The In Silico Lab-On-A-Chip","body":"### Running at 65% of Peak.\r\nThis is an HPC software for Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations of blood and cancer cell separation in complex microfluidic channels with subcellular resolution. It relies on CUDA and MPI to run efficiently on GPU-accelerated supercomputers, performing at 65.5% of the available 39.4 PetaInstructions/s in the 18'688 nodes of the Titan supercomputer.\r\n\r\n### Outperforming the competition by 45X. \r\nFor a shear layer flow problem, this software outperforms the GPU package of LAMMPS by 30-45X, from 27 to 18'600 nodes. In the limited range of nodes supported by HOOMD-Blue for this problem (up to 280), we report a constant outperforming factor of 4X.\r\n\r\n### Devising the next-generation of Lab-On-A-Chips.\r\nThe simulations delivered by this software outperform by one to three orders of magnitude the current state-of-the-art in terms of numbers of simulated red blood cells and computational  elements. The software emulates the conditions and the geometric complexity of microfluidic experiments. These simulations provide sub-micron resolution while accessing time scales relevant to engineering designs.\r\n\r\n![Simulation of the CTC-iChip1](http://n.ethz.ch/~diegor/uDeviceX.png)\r\n\r\n### This is a Free software.\r\nThe software is licensed with the GNU GPL v2.0.
