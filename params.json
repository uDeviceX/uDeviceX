{"name":"uDeviceX","tagline":"The In Silico Lab-On-A-Chip.","body":"### Running at 65% of Peak.\r\nThis software performs Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations of blood and cancer cell separation in complex microfluidic channels with subcellular resolution. It relies on CUDA and MPI to run efficiently on GPU-accelerated supercomputers, for example performing at 65.5% of the available 39.4 PetaInstructions/s in the 18'688 nodes of the Titan supercomputer.\r\n\r\n### Outperforming the competition by 45X. \r\nFor shear layer flow benchmarks, this software constantly outperforms the GPU package of LAMMPS by 30-45X, varying the number of nodes from 27 to 18'600. In the limited range of nodes supported by HOOMD-Blue (up to 280 for our benchmark), we report a constant outperforming factor of 4X.\r\n\r\n### Devising the next-generation of Lab-On-A-Chips.\r\nThe simulations delivered by this software outperform by one to three orders of magnitude the current state-of-the-art simulations in terms of numbers of red blood cells and computational  elements. The software emulates the conditions and the geometric complexity of microfluidic experiments. These simulations provide sub-micron resolution while accessing time scales relevant to engineering designs.\r\n\r\n![Simulation of the CTC-iChip1](http://n.ethz.ch/~diegor/uDeviceX.png)\r\n[uDeviceX movie.](http://n.ethz.ch/~cconti/download/CTC-iChip1.mp4)\r\nVisualization taken care by Christian Conti.\r\n\r\n### This is a Free software.\r\nThe software comes with the GNU GPL v2.0 license.
