Red blood cell. link:type.h[src/rbc/type.h] defines `struct rbc::Quants`

[[components]]
= Components

* adj adjacency list — a structure to pack mesh to read on device
* com compute center of mass
* edg store information for every edge (host)
* force internal forces
* gen generate `pp` from cell template (`rbc.off`) and initial condition
files (`rbcs-ic.txt`)
* link:com[main] initialization, restart
* rnd random numbers for internal forces
* rnd/api low level api for random number generator
* force/area_volume compute area and volume
* stretch apply a force to every vertex of every cell, force is set from
a file `rbc.stretch`
