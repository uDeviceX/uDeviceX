= generic [d]evice API

:lext: .adoc
:src: ../../../src

The goal is to make cuda API and kernel functions generic. Meaning
they can be replaced by CPU calls.

== interface

Wrappers for cuda functions:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/d/api.h[]
----

generic files of the interface
* `d/api.h` API calls
* `d/q.h` function and variable type qualifiers
* `d/ker.h`

== configuration

Generic device can by implemented by `cuda` and by `cpu`
* `d/cuda`
* `d/cpu`

if `DEV_CUDA` defined it is `cuda`, if `DEV_CPU` is defined it is
`cpu`. For `cpu` `KL_CPU` should be also defined.
